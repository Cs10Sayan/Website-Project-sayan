     Nepal is a country situated in South Asia. Nepal is bordered by two major giant countries, India and China. 
     Nepal is espically known for its Great Mountians, having 8 of the top 10 tallest mountians. Nepal has never been conquered dispite its small size, the Himalayas also make Nepal a difficult terrain to navigate through. Because Nepal hasn't been conquered they still follow their old calender system, so while the world is in the year 2023, Nepal is in 2080.
